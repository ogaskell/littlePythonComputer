# littlePythonComputer
A CPU simulator, inspired by LMC, written in Python.

I've been using the Little Man Computer in my Computer Science class quite frequently recently, and while easy to use, and great for begginers, it's quite limited once you start writing longer programs. For example, the maximum of 100 RAM addresses and the lack of logic operations. This inspired me to create this project.
